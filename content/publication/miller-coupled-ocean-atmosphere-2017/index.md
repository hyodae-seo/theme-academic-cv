abstract: Key aspects of the current state of the ability of global and regional climate
  models to represent dynamical processes and precipitation variations are summarized.
  Interannual, decadal, and globalwarming timescales, wherein the inﬂuence of the
  oceans is relevant and the potential for predictability is highest, are emphasized.
  Oceanic inﬂuences on climate occur throughout the ocean and extend over land to
  affect many types of climate variations, including monsoons, the El Niño Southern
  Oscillation, decadal oscillations, and the response to greenhouse gas emissions.
  The fundamental ideas of coupling between the ocean-atmosphere-land system are explained
  for these modes in both global and regional contexts. Global coupled climate models
  are needed to represent and understand the complicated processes involved and allow
  us to make predictions over land and sea. Regional coupled climate models are needed
  to enhance our interpretation of the ﬁne-scale response. The mechanisms by which
  large-scale, low-frequency variations can inﬂuence shorter timescale variations
  and drive regionalscale effects are also discussed. In this light of these processes,
  the prospects for practical climate predictability are also presented.
