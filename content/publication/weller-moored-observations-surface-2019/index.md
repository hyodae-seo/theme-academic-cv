abstract: Time series of surface meteorology and air–sea ﬂuxes from the northern Bay
  of Bengal are analyzed, quantifying annual and seasonal means, variability, and
  the potential for surface ﬂuxes to contribute signiﬁcantly to variability in surface
  temperature and salinity. Strong signals were associated with solar insolation and
  its modulation by cloud cover, and, in the 5- to 50-day range, with intraseasonal
  oscillations (ISOs). The northeast (NE) monsoon (DJF) was typically cloud free,
  with strong latent heat loss and several moderate wind events, and had the only
  seasonal mean ocean heat loss. The spring intermonsoon (MAM) was cloud free and
  had light winds and the strongest ocean heating. Strong ISOs and Tropical Cyclone
  Komen were seen in the southwest (SW) monsoon (JJA), when 65% of the 2.2-m total
  rain fell, and oceanic mean heating was small. The fall intermonsoon (SON) initially
  had moderate convective systems and mean ocean heating, with a transition to drier
  winds and mean ocean heat loss in the last month. Observed surface freshwater ﬂux
  applied to a layer of the observed thickness produced drops in salinity with timing
  and magnitude similar to the initial drops in salinity in the summer monsoon, but
  did not reproduce the salinity variability of the fall intermonsoon. Observed surface
  heat ﬂux has the potential to cause the temperature trends of the different seasons,
  but uncertainty in how shortwave radiation is absorbed in the upper ocean limits
  quantifying the role of surface forcing in the evolution of mixed layer temperature.
