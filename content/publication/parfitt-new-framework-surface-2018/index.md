abstract: It is well known that the wintertime time-mean surface wind convergence
  patterns over the Kuroshio Extension and Gulf Stream show signiﬁcant imprints of
  the underlying oceanic fronts. Previous studies have suggested that this collocation
  results from a time-mean response to sea level pressure forcing from sea surface
  temperature gradients. However, more recent work has illustrated this phenomenon
  is heavily inﬂuenced by extratropical cyclones, although exact mechanisms are still
  debated. The purpose of this study is to introduce a new framework that explicitly
  distinguishes between two separate components in their contribution to the time-mean
  surface wind convergence, that associated with and without atmospheric fronts. It
  is then argued that this distinction can help better explain the mechanisms driving
  the Kuroshio Extension and Gulf Stream inﬂuence on the atmosphere. Plain Language
  Summary This paper presents a new framework for understanding the mean wintertime
  atmospheric state over the Kuroshio Extension and Gulf Stream regions, in the context
  of advancing our understanding of how these strong ocean currents can impact on
  the seasonal atmosphere. In recent years, many studies have attributed the oceanic
  imprint on the atmosphere in these regions to mechanisms based upon the time-mean
  response. However, observational analysis here illustrates that the regional wintertime
  atmosphere is, in fact, dominated by continuous extratropical storm systems. It
  is suggested this contribution to the mean atmospheric state can be further decomposed
  into situations when atmospheric fronts embedded within these storms are and are
  not present. By studying each of these distinct atmospheric scenarios, it is then
  argued that the oceanic imprint on the mean wintertime atmospheric state should
  instead be considered as an accumulation of processes driven by mechanisms acting
  on a synoptic timescale, not on the timescale of the time-mean. This framework presents
  a new paradigm for understanding extratropical frontal-scale air-sea interactions
  and is expected to have an immediate impact on atmospheric, oceanic, and climate
  communities.
