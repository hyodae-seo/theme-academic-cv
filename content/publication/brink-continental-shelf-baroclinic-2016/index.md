abstract: Continental shelf baroclinic instability energized by ﬂuctuating alongshore
  winds is treated using idealized primitive equation numerical model experiments.
  A spatially uniform alongshore wind, sinusoidal in time, alternately drives upwelling
  and downwelling and so creates highly variable, but slowly increasing, available
  potential energy. For all of the 30 model runs, conducted with a wide range of parameters
  (varying Coriolis parameter, initial stratiﬁcation, bottom friction, forcing period,
  wind strength, and bottom slope), a baroclinic instability and subsequent eddy ﬁeld
  develop. Model results and scalings show that the eddy kinetic energy increases
  with wind amplitude, forcing period, stratiﬁcation, and bottom slope. The dominant
  alongshore length scale of the eddy ﬁeld is essentially an internal Rossby radius
  of deformation. The resulting depthaveraged alongshore ﬂow ﬁeld is dominated by
  the large-scale, periodic wind forcing, while the cross-shelf ﬂow ﬁeld is dominated
  by the eddy variability. The result is that correlation length scales for alongshore
  ﬂow are far greater than those for cross-shelf velocity. This scale discrepancy
  is qualitatively consistent with midshelf observations by Kundu and Allen, among
  others.
