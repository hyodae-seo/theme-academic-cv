 abstract = {Continental shelf baroclinic instability energized by ﬂuctuating alongshore winds is treated using idealized primitive equation numerical model experiments. A spatially uniform alongshore wind, sinusoidal in time, alternately drives upwelling and downwelling and so creates highly variable, but slowly increasing, available potential energy. For all of the 30 model runs, conducted with a wide range of parameters (varying Coriolis parameter, initial stratiﬁcation, bottom friction, forcing period, wind strength, and bottom slope), a baroclinic instability and subsequent eddy ﬁeld develop. Model results and scalings show that the eddy kinetic energy increases with wind amplitude, forcing period, stratiﬁcation, and bottom slope. The dominant alongshore length scale of the eddy ﬁeld is essentially an internal Rossby radius of deformation. The resulting depthaveraged alongshore ﬂow ﬁeld is dominated by the large-scale, periodic wind forcing, while the cross-shelf ﬂow ﬁeld is dominated by the eddy variability. The result is that correlation length scales for alongshore ﬂow are far greater than those for cross-shelf velocity. This scale discrepancy is qualitatively consistent with midshelf observations by Kundu and Allen, among others.},
