abstract: Abstract The Amazon river basin receives ~2000 mm of precipitation annually
  and contributes ~17% of global river freshwater input to the oceans; its hydroclimatic
  variations can exert profound impacts on the marine ecosystem in the Amazon plume
  region (APR) and have potential far-reaching influences on hydroclimate over the
  tropical Atlantic. Here, we show that an amplified seasonal cycle of Amazonia precipitation,
  represented by the annual difference between maximum and minimum values, during
  the period 1979â€“2018, leads to enhanced seasonalities in both Amazon river discharge
  and APR ocean salinity. An atmospheric moisture budget analysis shows that these
  enhanced seasonal cycles are associated with similar amplifications in the atmospheric
  vertical and horizontal moisture advections. Hierarchical sensitivity experiments
  using global climate models quantify the relationships of these enhanced seasonalities.
  The results suggest that an intensified hydroclimatological cycle may develop in
  the Amazonia atmosphere-land-ocean coupled system, favouring more extreme terrestrial
  and marine conditions.
