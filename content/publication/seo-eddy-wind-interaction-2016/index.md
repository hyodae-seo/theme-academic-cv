abstract: The summertime California Current System (CCS) is characterized by energetic
  mesoscale eddies, whose sea surface temperature (SST) and surface current can signiﬁcantly
  modify the wind stress and Ekman pumping. Relative importance of the eddy–wind interactions
  via SST and surface current in the CCS is examined using a high-resolution (7 km)
  regional coupled model with a novel coupling approach to isolate the small-scale
  air–sea coupling by SST and surface current. Results show that when the eddy-induced
  surface current is allowed to modify the wind stress, the spatially averaged surface
  eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is reduced by 42%, and this is primarily due to enhanced
  surface eddy drag and reduced wind energy transfer. In contrast, the eddy-induced
  SST–wind coupling has no signiﬁcant impact on the EKE. Furthermore, eddyinduced
  SST and surface current modify the Ekman pumping via their crosswind SST gradient
  and surface vorticity gradient, respectively. The resultant magnitudes of the Ekman
  pumping velocity are comparable, but the implied feedback effects on the eddy statistics
  are different. The surface current-induced Ekman pumping mainly attenuates the amplitude
  of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, acting to reduce the eddy activity, while the
  SST-induced Ekman pumping primarily affects the propagation. Time mean–rectiﬁed
  change in SST is determined by the altered offshore temperature advection by the
  mean and eddy currents, but the magnitude of the mean SST change is greater with
  the eddy-induced current effect. The demonstrated remarkably strong dynamical response
  in the CCS system to the eddy-induced current–wind coupling indicates that eddyinduced
  current should play an important role in the regional coupled ocean–atmosphere system.
