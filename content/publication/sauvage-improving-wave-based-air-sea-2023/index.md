abstract: In winter, the Northwest Tropical Atlantic Ocean can be characterized by
  various wave age-based interactions among ocean current, surface wind and surface
  waves, which are critical for accurately describing surface wind stress. In this
  work, coupled wave-ocean-atmosphere model simulations are conducted using two different
  wave roughness parameterizations within COARE3.5, including one that relies solely
  on wind speed and another that uses wave age and wave slope as inputs. Comparisons
  with the directly measured momentum fluxes during the ATOMIC/EUREC4A experiments
  in winter 2020 show that, for sea states dominated by short wind waves under moderate
  to strong winds, the wave-based formulation (WBF) increases the surface roughness
  length in average by 25% compared to the wind-speed-based approach. For sea states
  dominated by remotely generated swells under moderate to strong wind intensity,
  the WBF predicts significantly lower roughness length and surface stress (≈15%),
  resulting in increased near-surface wind speed above the constant flux layer (≈5%).
  Further investigation of the mixed sea states in the model and data indicates that
  the impact of swell on wind stress is over-emphasized in the COARE3.5 WBF, especially
  under moderate wind regimes. Various approaches are explored to alleviate this deficiency
  by either introducing directional alignment between wind and waves or using the
  mean wave period instead of the wave period corresponding to the spectral peak to
  compute the wave age. The findings of this study are likely to be site-dependent,
  and mostly concern specific regimes of wind and waves where the original parameterization
  was deficient.
