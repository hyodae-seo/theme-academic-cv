abstract: Analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) from coastal buoys suggests that
  the summertime over‐shelf water temperature off the U.S. West Coast has been declining
  during the past 30 years at an average rate of −0.19°C decade −1 . This cooling
  trend manifests itself more strongly off south‐central California than off Oregon
  and northern California. The variability and trend in the upwelling north of off
  San Francisco are positively correlated with those of the equatorward wind, indicating
  a role of offshore Ekman transport in the north. In contrast, Ekman pumping associated
  with wind stress curls better explains the stronger and statistically more significant
  cooling trend in the south. While the coast‐wide variability and trend in SST are
  strongly correlated with those of large‐scale modes of climate variability, they
  in general fail to explain the southward intensification of the trend in SST and
  wind stress curl. This result suggests that the local wind stress curl, often topographically
  forced, may have played a role in the upwelling trend pattern.  ,  Key Points    Summer
  SST off the U.S. West Coast has been declining since the 1980s   Cooling trend is
  more significant in Central and Southern California   Ekman pumping explains the
  stronger cooling trend in the south
