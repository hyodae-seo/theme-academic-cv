abstract: The North Atlantic atmospheric circulation response to the meridional shifts
  of the Gulf Stream (GS) path is examined using a large ensemble of high-resolution
  hemispheric-scale Weather Research and Forecasting Model simulations. The model
  is forced with a broad range of wintertime sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies
  derived from a lag regression on a GS index. The primary result of the model experiments,
  supported in part by an independent analysis of a reanalysis dataset, is that the
  large-scale quasi-steady North Atlantic circulation response is remarkably nonlinear
  about the sign and amplitude of the SST anomaly chosen over a wide range of GS shift
  scenarios. The nonlinear response prevails over the weak linear response and resembles
  the negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the leading intrinsic mode of variability
  in the model and the observations. Further analysis of the associated dynamics reveals
  that the nonlinear responses are accompanied by the shift of the North Atlantic
  eddy-driven jet, which is reinforced, with nearly equal importance, by the high-frequency
  transient eddy feedback and the low-frequency wave-breaking events. Additional sensitivity
  simulations conﬁrm that the nonlinearity of the circulation response is a robust
  feature found over the broad parameter space encompassing not only the varied SST
  but also the absence/presence of tropical inﬂuence, the varying lateral boundary
  conditions, and the initialization scheme. The result highlights the fundamental
  importance of the intrinsically nonlinear transient eddy dynamics and the eddy–mean
  ﬂow interactions in generating the nonlinear downstream response to the meridional
  shifts in the Gulf Stream.
