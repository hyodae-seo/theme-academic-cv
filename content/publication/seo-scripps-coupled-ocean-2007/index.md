abstract: A regional coupled ocean–atmosphere model is introduced. It is designed
  to admit the air– sea feedbacks arising in the presence of an oceanic mesoscale
  eddy field. It consists of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and the Regional
  Spectral Model (RSM). Large-scale forcing is provided by NCEP/DOE reanalysis fields,
  which have physics consistent with the RSM. Coupling allows the sea surface temperature
  (SST) to influence the stability of the atmospheric boundary layer and, hence, the
  surface wind stress and heat flux fields. The system is denominated the Scripps
  Coupled Ocean– Atmosphere Regional (SCOAR) Model.
