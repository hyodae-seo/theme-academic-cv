abstract: In this article, a simple diagnostic to identify atmospheric fronts objectively
  from gridded data sets is presented. For this diagnostic, fronts are identiﬁed as
  regions where the normalized product of the isobaric relative vorticity and horizontal
  temperature gradient exceeds a threshold value. The purpose is to introduce a method
  that is both robust and particularly straightforward in calculation. A climatology
  of atmospheric fronts, as well as the identiﬁcation of an individual frontal system,
  is computed using this diagnostic. These are subsequently compared to a more traditional
  frontal detection method and the similarities and differences discussed.
