abstract: 'textlessptextgreaterThe offshore wind energy sector has rapidly expanded
  over the past two decades, providing a renewable energy solution for coastal nations.
  Sector development has been led in Europe, but is growing globally. Most developments
  to date have been in well-mixed, i.e., unstratified, shallow-waters near to shore.
  Sector growth is, for the first time, pushing developments to deep water, into a
  brand new environment: seasonally stratified shelf seas. Seasonally stratified shelf
  seas, where water density varies with depth, have a disproportionately key role
  in primary production, marine ecosystem and biogeochemical cycling. Infrastructure
  will directly mix stratified shelf seas. The magnitude of this mixing, additional
  to natural background processes, has yet to be fully quantified. If large enough
  it may erode shelf sea stratification. Therefore, offshore wind growth may destabilize
  and fundamentally change shelf sea systems. However, enhanced mixing may also positively
  impact some marine ecosystems. This paper sets the scene for sector development
  into this new environment, reviews the potential physical and environmental benefits
  and impacts of large scale industrialization of seasonally stratified shelf seas
  and identifies areas where research is required to best utilize, manage, and mitigate
  environmental change.textless/ptextgreater'
