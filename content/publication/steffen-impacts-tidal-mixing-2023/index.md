abstract: The Maritime Continent (MC) is a region with enhanced tidal mixing and ocean
  cooling, which influences regional-scale sea surface temperatures (SSTs). We examine
  the coupled impacts of tidal mixing on near-surface stratification, SST, and deep
  convection on diurnal and intraseasonal time-scales, using ensembles of highresolution,
  coupled ocean-atmosphere regional model simulations, with and without tidal forcing.
  Results show that the area-averaged SST in the eastern MC is reduced by 0.20 ◦C
  due to tidal forcing, with cooling exceeding 1 ◦C in the nearshore zones of shallow
  and complex bathymetry. The reduced SSTs decrease surface heat fluxes, leading to
  tropospheric drying and reduced precipitation, which are most pronounced in the
  near­ shore zones. The results show that the magnitude of tidally-induced SST cooling
  is phase-dependent during the passage of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO). Strong
  westerly winds enhance entrainment cooling through wind-driven mixing and upwelling
  during the active phase. Conversely, the upper-ocean stratification is enhanced
  during the suppressed phase, and SSTs are less sensitive to subsurface cooling.
  Such spatio-temporal variability in the SST response to tides is accompanied by
  consistent changes to deep convection and atmo­ spheric circulation. On the diurnal
  time-scale, nearshore cooling weakens the early-morning convection when the land-based
  convection propagates offshore and interacts with the cooler SST. On intraseasonal
  time-scales, the coupling between SST and precipitation is strengthened because
  of the asymmetric impacts of tideinduced mixing on SST and MJO-induced winds. The
  robust SST and precipitation responses demonstrated in this study suggest the need
  for an accurate representation of tidal forcing and vertical mixing processes in
  local MJO prediction models for the MC.
