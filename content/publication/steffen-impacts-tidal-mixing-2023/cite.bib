 abstract = {The Maritime Continent (MC) is a region with enhanced tidal mixing and ocean cooling, which influences regional-scale sea surface temperatures (SSTs). We examine the coupled impacts of tidal mixing on near-surface stratification, SST, and deep convection on diurnal and intraseasonal time-scales, using ensembles of highresolution, coupled ocean-atmosphere regional model simulations, with and without tidal forcing. Results show that the area-averaged SST in the eastern MC is reduced by 0.20 ◦C due to tidal forcing, with cooling exceeding 1 ◦C in the nearshore zones of shallow and complex bathymetry. The reduced SSTs decrease surface heat fluxes, leading to tropospheric drying and reduced precipitation, which are most pronounced in the near­ shore zones. The results show that the magnitude of tidally-induced SST cooling is phase-dependent during the passage of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO). Strong westerly winds enhance entrainment cooling through wind-driven mixing and upwelling during the active phase. Conversely, the upper-ocean stratification is enhanced during the suppressed phase, and SSTs are less sensitive to subsurface cooling. Such spatio-temporal variability in the SST response to tides is accompanied by consistent changes to deep convection and atmo­ spheric circulation. On the diurnal time-scale, nearshore cooling weakens the early-morning convection when the land-based convection propagates offshore and interacts with the cooler SST. On intraseasonal time-scales, the coupling between SST and precipitation is strengthened because of the asymmetric impacts of tideinduced mixing on SST and MJO-induced winds. The robust SST and precipitation responses demonstrated in this study suggest the need for an accurate representation of tidal forcing and vertical mixing processes in local MJO prediction models for the MC.},
