abstract: Decadal variability of the subsurface ocean heat content (OHC) in the Indian
  Ocean is investigated using a coupled climate model experiment, in which observed
  eastern tropical Paciﬁc sea surface temperature (EPSST) anomalies are speciﬁed.
  This study intends to understand the contributions of external forcing relative
  to those of internal variability associated with EPSST, as well as the mechanisms
  by which the Paciﬁc impacts Indian Ocean OHC. Internally generated variations associated
  with EPSST dominate decadal variations in the subsurface Indian Ocean. Consistent
  with ocean reanalyses, the coupled model reproduces a pronounced east–west dipole
  structure in the southern tropical Indian Ocean and discontinuities in westwardpropagating
  signals in the central Indian Ocean around 1008E. This implies distinct mechanisms
  by which the Paciﬁc impacts the eastern and western Indian Ocean on decadal time
  scales. Decadal variations of OHC in the eastern Indian Ocean are attributed to
  1) western Paciﬁc surface wind anomalies, which trigger oceanic Rossby waves propagating
  westward through the Indonesian Seas and inﬂuence Indonesian Throughﬂow transport,
  and 2) zonal wind anomalies over the central tropical Indian Ocean, which trigger
  eastwardpropagating Kelvin waves. Decadal variations of OHC in the western Indian
  Ocean are linked to conditions in the Paciﬁc via changes in the atmospheric Walker
  cell, which trigger anomalous wind stress curl and Ekman pumping in the central
  tropical Indian Ocean. Westward-propagating oceanic Rossby waves extend the inﬂuence
  of this anomalous Ekman pumping to the western Indian Ocean.
