 abstract = {Decadal variability of the subsurface ocean heat content (OHC) in the Indian Ocean is investigated using a coupled climate model experiment, in which observed eastern tropical Paciﬁc sea surface temperature (EPSST) anomalies are speciﬁed. This study intends to understand the contributions of external forcing relative to those of internal variability associated with EPSST, as well as the mechanisms by which the Paciﬁc impacts Indian Ocean OHC. Internally generated variations associated with EPSST dominate decadal variations in the subsurface Indian Ocean. Consistent with ocean reanalyses, the coupled model reproduces a pronounced east–west dipole structure in the southern tropical Indian Ocean and discontinuities in westwardpropagating signals in the central Indian Ocean around 1008E. This implies distinct mechanisms by which the Paciﬁc impacts the eastern and western Indian Ocean on decadal time scales. Decadal variations of OHC in the eastern Indian Ocean are attributed to 1) western Paciﬁc surface wind anomalies, which trigger oceanic Rossby waves propagating westward through the Indonesian Seas and inﬂuence Indonesian Throughﬂow transport, and 2) zonal wind anomalies over the central tropical Indian Ocean, which trigger eastwardpropagating Kelvin waves. Decadal variations of OHC in the western Indian Ocean are linked to conditions in the Paciﬁc via changes in the atmospheric Walker cell, which trigger anomalous wind stress curl and Ekman pumping in the central tropical Indian Ocean. Westward-propagating oceanic Rossby waves extend the inﬂuence of this anomalous Ekman pumping to the western Indian Ocean.},
