abstract: Atmospheric fronts embedded in extratropical cyclones are high-impact weather
  phenomena, contributing significantly to mid-latitude winter precipitation. The
  three vital characteristics of the atmospheric fronts, high wind speeds, abrupt
  change in wind direction, and rapid translation, force the induced surface waves
  to be misaligned with winds exclusively behind the cold fronts. The effects of the
  misaligned waves under atmospheric cold fronts on air-sea fluxes remain undocumented.
  Using the multi-year in situ near-surface observations and direct covariance flux
  measurements from the Pioneer Array off the coast of New England, we find that the
  majority of the passing cold fronts generate misaligned waves behind the cold front.
  Once generated, the waves remain misaligned, on average, for about 8 hr. The parameterized
  effect of misaligned waves in a fully coupled model significantly increases the
  roughness length (185%), drag coefficient (19%), and air-sea momentum flux (11%).
  The increased surface drag reduces the wind speeds in the surface layer. The upward
  turbulent heat flux is weakly decreased by the misaligned waves because of the decrease
  in temperature and humidity scaling parameters being greater than the increase in
  friction velocity. The misaligned wave effect is not accurately represented in a
  commonly used wave-based bulk flux algorithm. Yet, considering this effect in the
  current formulation improves the overall accuracy of parameterized momentum flux
  estimates. The results imply that better representing a directional wind-wave coupling
  in the bulk formula of the numerical models may help improve the air-sea interaction
  simulations under the passing atmospheric fronts in the mid-latitudes.
