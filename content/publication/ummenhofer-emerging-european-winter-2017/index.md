abstract: Dominant European winter precipitation patterns over the past century, along
  with their associated extratropical North Atlantic circulation changes, are evaluated
  using cluster analysis. Contrary to the four regimes traditionally identiﬁed based
  on daily wintertime atmospheric circulation patterns, ﬁve distinct seasonal precipitation
  regimes are detected here. Recurrent precipitation patterns in each regime are linked
  to changes in atmospheric blocking, storm track, and sea surface temperatures across
  the North Atlantic region. Multidecadal variability in the frequency of the precipitation
  patterns reveals more (fewer) winters with wet conditions in northern (southern)
  Europe in recent decades and an emerging distinct pattern of enhanced wintertime
  precipitation over the northern British Isles. This pattern has become unusually
  common since the 1980s and is associated with changes in moisture transport and
  more frequent atmospheric river events. The observed precipitation changes post-1950
  coincide with changes in storm track activity over the central/eastern North Atlantic
  toward the northern British Isles.
