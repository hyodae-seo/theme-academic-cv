abstract: Recent studies have suggested that coherent multidecadal variability exists
  between North Atlantic atmospheric blocking frequency and the Atlantic multidecadal
  variability (AMV). However, the role of AMV in modulating blocking variability on
  multidecadal times scales is not fully understood. This study examines this issue
  primarily using the NOAA Twentieth Century Reanalysis for 1901–2010. The second
  mode of the empirical orthogonal function for winter (December–March) atmospheric
  blocking variability in the North Atlantic exhibits oppositely signed anomalies
  of blocking frequency over Greenland and the Azores. Furthermore, its principal
  component time series shows a dominant multidecadal variability lagging AMV by several
  years. Composite analyses show that this lag is due to the slow evolution of the
  AMV sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, which is likely driven by the ocean
  circulation. Following the warm phase of AMV, the warm SST anomalies emerge in the
  western subpolar gyre over 3–7 years. The ocean–atmosphere interaction over these
  3–7-yr periods is characterized by the damping of the warm SST anomalies by the
  surface heat ﬂux anomalies, which in turn reduce the overall meridional gradient
  of the air temperature and thus weaken the meridional transient eddy heat ﬂux in
  the lower troposphere. The anomalous transient eddy forcing then shifts the eddy-driven
  jet equatorward, resulting in enhanced Rossby wave breaking and blocking on the
  northern ﬂank of the jet over Greenland. The opposite is true with the AMV cold
  phases but with much shorter lags, as the evolution of SST anomalies differs in
  the warm and cold phases.
