abstract: The Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations (MISO) is known to be strongly coupled
  to the upper ocean variability in the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Here, we analyze highresolution
  moored observations from the northern BoB (18 °N, in comparison with an array of
  moorings to the south along 90 °E (8, 12, and 15 °N) to examine the observed temperature
  and salinity variability during the 2015 summer monsoon season. The heat budget
  analysis indicates that the mixed-layer (ML) temperature tendency at 18 °N in late
  summer (August and September) deviated greatly from the tendency that is expected
  based on surface heat flux alone. Examination of moored ML salinity and satellite
  sea surface salinity (SSS) fields suggests that southward extension of riverine
  freshwater plumes to the mooring site in late summer plays an important role in
  modulating the heat balance. The associated shoaling of the ML results in enhanced
  penetrative heat loss and warming beneath the surface layer. Price-Weller-Pinkel
  (PWP) 1-D model simulations, which account for vertical mixing, suggest that the
  entrainment of this subsurface warm water under monsoon wind improves closure of
  the temperature balance. Long-term analysis of satellite-based sea surface temperature
  (SST) and rainfall data indicates that late summer ML shoaling is accompanied by
  amplified intraseasonal (10–60 day) SST variability and reduced MISO precipitation
  variability. Overall, these results demonstrate the critical importance of freshwater
  plumes to improved understanding of the upper-ocean heat budget and air-sea interaction
  in the BoB.
