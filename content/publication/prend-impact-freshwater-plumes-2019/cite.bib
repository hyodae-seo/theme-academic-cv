 abstract = {The Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations (MISO) is known to be strongly coupled to the upper ocean variability in the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Here, we analyze highresolution moored observations from the northern BoB (18 °N, in comparison with an array of moorings to the south along 90 °E (8, 12, and 15 °N) to examine the observed temperature and salinity variability during the 2015 summer monsoon season. The heat budget analysis indicates that the mixed-layer (ML) temperature tendency at 18 °N in late summer (August and September) deviated greatly from the tendency that is expected based on surface heat flux alone. Examination of moored ML salinity and satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) fields suggests that southward extension of riverine freshwater plumes to the mooring site in late summer plays an important role in modulating the heat balance. The associated shoaling of the ML results in enhanced penetrative heat loss and warming beneath the surface layer. Price-Weller-Pinkel (PWP) 1-D model simulations, which account for vertical mixing, suggest that the entrainment of this subsurface warm water under monsoon wind improves closure of the temperature balance. Long-term analysis of satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall data indicates that late summer ML shoaling is accompanied by amplified intraseasonal (10–60 day) SST variability and reduced MISO precipitation variability. Overall, these results demonstrate the critical importance of freshwater plumes to improved understanding of the upper-ocean heat budget and air-sea interaction in the BoB.},
