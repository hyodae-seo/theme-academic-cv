abstract: Effects of freshwater forcing from river discharge into the Indian Ocean
  on oceanic vertical structure and the Indian monsoons are investigated using a fully
  coupled, high-resolution, regional climate model. The effect of river discharge
  is included in the model by restoring sea surface salinity (SSS) toward observations.
  The simulations with and without this effect in the coupled model reveal a highly
  seasonal inﬂuence of salinity and the barrier layer (BL) on oceanic vertical density
  stratiﬁcation, which is in turn linked to changes in sea surface temperature (SST),
  surface winds, and precipitation.
