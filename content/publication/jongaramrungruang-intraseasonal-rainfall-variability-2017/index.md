abstract: The Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall exhibits pronounced intraseasonal variability
  in the Bay of Bengal (BoB). This study examines the intraseasonal rainfall variability
  with foci on the coupling with sea surface temperatures (SST) and its interannual
  modulation. The lagged composite analysis reveals that, in the northern BoB, SST
  warming leads the onset of intraseasonal rainfall by 5 days. Latent heat flux is
  reduced before the rain event but is greatly amplified during the rainfall maxima.
  Further analysis reveals that this intraseasonal rainfall-SST relationship through
  latent heating is strengthened in negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) years when
  the bay-wide local SST is anomalously warm. Latent heat flux is further increased
  during the intraseasonal rainfall maxima leading to strengthened rainfall variability.
  The moisture budget analysis shows this is primarily due to stronger low-level moisture
  convergence in negative IOD years. The results provide important predictive information
  on the monsoon rainfall and its active/break cycles.
