abstract: This study quantiﬁes, from a systematic set of regional ocean–atmosphere
  coupled model simulations employing various coupling intervals, the effect of subdaily
  sea surface temperature (SST) variability on the onset and intensity of Madden–Julian
  oscillation (MJO) convection in the Indian Ocean. The primary effect of diurnal
  SST variation (dSST) is to raise time-mean SST and latent heat ﬂux (LH) prior to
  deep convection. Diurnal SST variation also strengthens the diurnal moistening of
  the troposphere by collocating the diurnal peak in LH with those of SST. Both effects
  enhance the convection such that the total precipitation amount scales quasi-linearly
  with preconvection dSST and time-mean SST. A column-integrated moist static energy
  (MSE) budget analysis conﬁrms the critical role of diurnal SST variability in the
  buildup of column MSE and the strength of MJO convection via stronger time-mean
  LH and diurnal moistening. Two complementary atmosphere-only simulations further
  elucidate the role of SST conditions in the predictive skill of MJO. The atmospheric
  model forced with the persistent initial SST, lacking enhanced preconvection warming
  and moistening, produces a weaker and delayed convection than the diurnally coupled
  run. The atmospheric model with prescribed daily-mean SST from the coupled run,
  while eliminating the delayed peak, continues to exhibit weaker convection due to
  the lack of strong moistening on a diurnal basis. The fact that time-evolving SST
  with a diurnal cycle strongly inﬂuences the onset and intensity of MJO convection
  is consistent with previous studies that identiﬁed an improved representation of
  diurnal SST as a potential source of MJO predictability.
