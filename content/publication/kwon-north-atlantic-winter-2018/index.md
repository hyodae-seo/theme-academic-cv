abstract: The atmospheric jet and blocking distributions, especially in the North
  Atlantic sector, have been challenging features for a climate model to realistically
  reproduce. This study examines climatological distributions of winter (December–February)
  daily jet latitude and blocking in the North Atlantic from the 40-member Community
  Earth System Model version 1 Large Ensemble (CESM1LE) simulations. This analysis
  aims at examining whether a broad range of internal climate variability encompassed
  by a large ensemble of simulations results in an improved representation of the
  jet latitude distributions and blocking days in CESM1LE. In the historical runs
  (1951–2005), the daily zonal wind at 850 hPa exhibits three distinct preferred latitudes
  for the eddy-driven jet position as seen in the reanalysis datasets, which represents
  a significant improvement from the previous version of the same model. However,
  the meridional separations between the three jet latitudes are much smaller than
  those in the reanalyses. In particular, the jet rarely migrates to the observed
  southernmost position around 37°N. This leads to the bias in blocking frequency
  that is too low over Greenland and too high over the Azores. These features are
  shown to be remarkably stable across the 40 ensemble members with negligible member-to-member
  spread. This result implies the range of internal variability of winter jet latitude
  and blocking frequency within the 55-year segment from each ensemble member is comparable
  to that represented by the full large ensemble. Comparison with 2046–2100 from the
  RCP8.5 future projection runs suggests that the daily jet position is projected
  to maintain the same three preferred latitudes, with a slightly higher frequency
  of occurrence over the central latitude around 50°N, instead of shifting poleward
  in the future as documented in some previous studies. In addition, the daily jet
  speed is projected not to change significantly between 1951–2005 and 2046–2100.
  On the other hand, the climatological mean jet is projected to become slightly more
  elongated and stronger on its southern flank, and the blocking frequency over the
  Azores is projected to decrease.
