abstract: In the Bay of Bengal, the warm, dry boreal spring concludes with the onset
  of the summer monsoon and accompanying southwesterly winds, heavy rains, and variable
  air–sea fluxes. Here, we summarize the 2018 monsoon onset using observations collected
  through the multinational Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations in the Bay of Bengal
  (MISO-BoB) program between the United States, India, and Sri Lanka. MISO-BoB aims
  to improve understanding of monsoon intraseasonal variability, and the 2018 field
  effort captured the coupled air–sea response during a transition from active-to-break
  conditions in the central BoB. The active phase of the ~20-day research cruise was
  characterized by warm sea surface temperature (SST textgreater 30°C), cold atmospheric
  outflows with intermittent heavy rainfall, and increasing winds (from 2 to 15 m
  s−1). Accumulated rainfall exceeded 200 mm with 90% of precipitation occurring during
  the first week. The following break period was both dry and clear, with persistent
  10–12 m s−1 wind and evaporation of 0.2 mm h−1. The evolving environmental state
  included a deepening ocean mixed layer (from ~20 to 50 m), cooling SST (by ~1°C),
  and warming/drying of the lower to midtroposphere. Local atmospheric development
  was consistent with phasing of the large-scale intraseasonal oscillation. The upper
  ocean stores significant heat in the BoB, enough to maintain SST above 29°C despite
  cooling by surface fluxes and ocean mixing. Comparison with reanalysis indicates
  biases in air–sea fluxes, which may be related to overly cool prescribed SST. Resolution
  of such biases offers a path toward improved forecasting of transition periods in
  the monsoon.
