abstract: The rainfall over the U.S. West Coast is known to be highly influenced by
  large-scale atmospheric circulation and tropical climate teleconnections. However,
  the role of North Pacific oceanic variability is less understood. Using high-resolution
  regional atmospheric model simulations forced by sustained positive and negative
  phases of the extratropical Pacific Decadal Oscillation sea surface temperature
  anomalies (SSTa), we diagnose the precipitation changes over the U.S. West Coast
  during 2010–2020. We find that precipitation anomalies are up to 60% stronger (weaker)
  for the warm (cold) cases, especially over Northern and Central California during
  wintertime, and Baja California in the summertime. In both seasons, precipitation
  is predominantly modulated through changes in the water vapor flux, which are directed
  toward the coast in wintertime and away from the coast during summertime. These
  flux anomalies are primarily driven by large-scale changes in the wind associated
  with the atmospheric adjustment to the strong ocean SSTa.
