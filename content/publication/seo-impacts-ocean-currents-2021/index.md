abstract: This study examines the role of the relative wind (RW) effect (wind relative
  to ocean current) in the regional ocean circulation and extratropical storm track
  in the south Indian Ocean. Comparison of two high-resolution regional coupled model
  simulations with and without the RW effect reveals that the most conspicuous ocean
  circulation response is the signiﬁcant weakening of the overly energetic anticyclonic
  standing eddy off Port Elizabeth, South Africa, a biased feature ascribed to upstream
  retroﬂection of the Agulhas Current (AC). This opens a pathway through which the
  AC transports the warm and salty water mass from the subtropics, yielding marked
  increases in sea surface temperature (SST), upward turbulent heat ﬂux (THF), and
  meridional SST gradient in the Agulhas retroﬂection region. These thermodynamic
  and dynamic changes are accompanied by the robust strengthening of the local low-tropospheric
  baroclinicity and the baroclinic wave activity in the atmosphere. Examination of
  the composite life cycle of synoptic-scale storms subjected to the high-THF events
  indicates a robust strengthening of the extratropical storms far downstream. Energetics
  calculations for the atmosphere suggest that the baroclinic energy conversion from
  the basic ﬂow is the chief source of increased eddy available potential energy,
  which is subsequently converted to eddy kinetic energy, providing for the growth
  of transient baroclinic waves. Overall, the results suggest that the mechanical
  and thermal air–sea interactions are inherently and inextricably linked together
  to substantially inﬂuence the extratropical storm tracks in the south Indian Ocean.
