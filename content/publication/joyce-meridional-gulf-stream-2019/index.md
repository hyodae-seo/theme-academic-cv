abstract: Abstract  After leaving the U.S. East Coast, the northward flowing Gulf
  Stream (GS) becomes a zonal jet and carries along its frontal characteristics of
  strong flow and sea surface temperature gradients into the North Atlantic at midlatitudes.
  The separation location where it leaves the coast is also an anchor point for the
  wintertime synoptic storm track across North America to continue to develop and
  head across the ocean. We examine the meridional variability of the separated GS
  path on interannual to decadal time scales as an agent for similar changes in the
  storm track and blocking variability at midtroposphere from 1979 to 2012. We find
  that periods of northerly (southerly) GS path are associated with increased (suppressed)
  excursions of the synoptic storm track to the northeast over the Labrador Sea and
  reduced (enhanced) Greenland blocking. In both instances, GS shifts lead those in
  the midtroposphere by a few months.  ,  Plain Language Summary Using data from a
  34‐year period (1979–2012 inclusive), we have examined the relationship between
  wintertime atmospheric blocking events near Greenland and changes in the synoptic
  atmospheric storm track with interannual changes in the latitude of the Gulf Stream
  (GS) in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Results indicate that ocean changes in
  GS path precede those in the middle of the overlying atmosphere by 1–3 months, with
  opposite affects upon blocking and storm track. We take this as an indication that
  GS path shifts can significantly influence climate change in the wintertime atmosphere
  regionally, especially over the Labrador Sea and Greenland. ,  Key Points    Interannual
  changes in the zonal mean latitude of the separated Gulf Stream can be detected
  and related to changes in overlying atmosphere   Northerly GS paths are associated
  with enhanced storm tracks over Labrador Sea and Greenland, with more zonal storm
  tracks with southerly GS   Greenland blocking center expands with a southerly GS
  path and is reduced with a northerly GS path
