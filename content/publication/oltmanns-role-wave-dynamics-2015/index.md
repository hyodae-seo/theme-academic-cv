abstract: In Ammassalik, in southeast Greenland, downslope winds can reach hurricane
  intensity and represent a hazard for the local population and environment. They
  advect cold air down the ice sheet and over the Irminger Sea, where they drive large
  ocean–atmosphere heat ﬂuxes over an important ocean convection region. Earlier studies
  have found them to be associated with a strong katabatic acceleration over the steep
  coastal slopes, ﬂow convergence inside the valley of Ammassalik, and—in one instance—mountain
  wave breaking. Yet, for the general occurrence of strong downslope wind events,
  the importance of mesoscale processes is largely unknown. Here, two wind events—one
  weak and one strong—are simulated with the atmospheric Weather Research and Forecasting
  (WRF) Model with different model and topography resolutions, ranging from 1.67 to
  60 km. For both events, but especially for the strong one, it is found that lower
  resolutions underestimate the wind speed because they misrepresent the steepness
  of the topography and do not account for the underlying wave dynamics. If a 5-km
  model instead of a 60-km model resolution in Ammassalik is used, the ﬂow associated
  with the strong wind event is faster by up to 20 m s21. The effects extend far downstream
  over the Irminger Sea, resulting in a diverging spatial distribution and temporal
  evolution of the heat ﬂuxes. Local differences in the heat ﬂuxes amount to 20%,
  with potential implications for ocean convection.
