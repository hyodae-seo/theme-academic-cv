abstract: 'The recently released NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) is
  used to examine the response to ENSO in the northeast tropical Paciﬁc Ocean (NETP)
  during 1979–2009. The normally cool Paciﬁc sea surface temperatures (SSTs) associated
  with wind jets through the gaps in the Central American mountains at Tehuantepec,
  Papagayo, and Panama are substantially warmer (colder) than the surrounding ocean
  during El Nin˜ o (La Nin˜ a) events. Ocean dynamics generate the ENSO-related SST
  anomalies in the gap wind regions as the surface ﬂuxes damp the SSTs anomalies,
  while the Ekman heat transport is generally in quadrature with the anomalies. The
  ENSO-driven warming is associated with large-scale deepening of the thermocline;
  with the cold thermocline water at greater depths during El Nin˜ o in the NETP,
  it is less likely to be vertically mixed to the surface, particularly in the gap
  wind regions where the thermocline is normally very close to the surface. The thermocline
  deepening is enhanced to the south of the Costa Rica Dome in the Papagayo region,
  which contributes to the local ENSO-driven SST anomalies. The NETP thermocline changes
  are due to coastal Kelvin waves that initiate westward-propagating Rossby waves,
  and possibly ocean eddies, rather than by local Ekman pumping. These ﬁndings were
  conﬁrmed with regional ocean model experiments: only integrations that included
  interannually varying ocean boundary conditions were able to simulate the thermocline
  deepening and localized warming in the NETP during El Nin˜ o events; the simulation
  with variable surface ﬂuxes, but boundary conditions that repeated the seasonal
  cycle, did not.'
