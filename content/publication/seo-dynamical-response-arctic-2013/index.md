abstract: Impact of sea‐ice concentration (SIC) on the Arctic atmospheric boundary
  layer (ABL) is investigated using a polar‐optimized version of the Weather Research
  and Forecasting (Polar WRF) model forced with SIC conditions during three different
  years. We present a detailed comparison of the simulations with historical ship
  and ice station based data focusing on September. Our analysis shows that Polar
  WRF provides a reasonable representation of the observed ABL evolution provided
  that SIC uncertainties are small. Lower skill is obtained, however, with elevated
  SIC uncertainties associated with incorrect seasonal evolution of sea ice and misrepresentation
  of ice thickness near the marginal ice zone (MIZ). The result underscores the importance
  of accurate representation of ice conditions for skillful simulation of the Arctic
  ABL. Further, two dynamically distinctive effects of sea ice on the surface wind
  were found, which act on different spatial scales. Reduced SIC lowers ABL stability,
  thereby increasing surface‐wind (W10) speeds. The spatial scale of this response
  is comparable to the basin scale of the SIC difference. In contrast, near‐surface
  geostrophic wind (Wg) shows a strong response in the MIZ, where a good spatial correspondence
  exists among the Laplacian of the sea level pressure (SLP), the surface‐wind convergence,
  and the vertical motion within the ABL. This indicates that SIC affects Wg through
  variation in SLP but on a much narrower scale. Larger‐amplitude and broader‐scale
  response in W10 implies that surface‐wind stress derived from Wg to drive ice‐ocean
  models may not fully reflect the effect of SIC changes. ,  Key Points    Polar WRF
