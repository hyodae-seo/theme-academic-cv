abstract: Recent results using wind and sea surface temperature data from satellites
  and high-resolution coupled models suggest that mesoscale ocean–atmosphere interactions
  aﬀect the locations and evolution of storms and seasonal precipitation over continental
  regions such as the western US and Europe. The processes responsible for this coupling
  are diﬃcult to verify due to the paucity of accurate air–sea turbulent heat and
  moisture ﬂux data. These ﬂuxes are currently derived by combining satellite measurements
  that are not coincident and have diﬀering and relatively low spatial resolutions,
  introducing sampling errors that are largest in regions with high spatial and temporal
  variability. Observational errors related to sensor design also contribute to increased
  uncertainty. Leveraging recent advances in sensor technology, we here describe a
  satellite mission concept, FluxSat, that aims to simultaneously measure all variables
  necessary for accurate estimation of ocean–atmosphere turbulent heat and moisture
  ﬂuxes and capture the eﬀect of oceanic mesoscale forcing. Sensor design is expected
  to reduce observational errors of the latent and sensible heat ﬂuxes by almost 50%.
  FluxSat will improve the accuracy of the ﬂuxes at spatial scales critical to understanding
  the coupled ocean–atmosphere boundary layer system, providing measurements needed
  to improve weather forecasts and climate model simulations.
