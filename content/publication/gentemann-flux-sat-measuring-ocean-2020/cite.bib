 abstract = {Recent results using wind and sea surface temperature data from satellites and high-resolution coupled models suggest that mesoscale ocean–atmosphere interactions aﬀect the locations and evolution of storms and seasonal precipitation over continental regions such as the western US and Europe. The processes responsible for this coupling are diﬃcult to verify due to the paucity of accurate air–sea turbulent heat and moisture ﬂux data. These ﬂuxes are currently derived by combining satellite measurements that are not coincident and have diﬀering and relatively low spatial resolutions, introducing sampling errors that are largest in regions with high spatial and temporal variability. Observational errors related to sensor design also contribute to increased uncertainty. Leveraging recent advances in sensor technology, we here describe a satellite mission concept, FluxSat, that aims to simultaneously measure all variables necessary for accurate estimation of ocean–atmosphere turbulent heat and moisture ﬂuxes and capture the eﬀect of oceanic mesoscale forcing. Sensor design is expected to reduce observational errors of the latent and sensible heat ﬂuxes by almost 50%. FluxSat will improve the accuracy of the ﬂuxes at spatial scales critical to understanding the coupled ocean–atmosphere boundary layer system, providing measurements needed to improve weather forecasts and climate model simulations.},
