abstract: Observations of the western Arabian Sea over the last decade have revealed
  a rich ﬁlamentary eddy structure, with large horizontal SST gradients in the ocean,
  developing in response to the southwest monsoon winds. This summertime oceanic condition
  triggers an intense mesoscale coupled interaction, whose overall inﬂuence on the
  longer-term properties of this ocean remains uncertain. In this study, a high-resolution
  regional coupled model is employed to explore this feedback effect on the long-term
  dynamical and thermodynamical structure of the ocean.
