abstract: A regional coupled climate model is configured for the tropical Atlantic
  to explore the role of synopticscale African easterly waves (AEWs) on the simulation
  of mean precipitation in the marine intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Sensitivity
  tests with varying atmospheric resolution in the coupled model show that these easterly
  waves are well represented with comparable amplitudes on both fine and coarse grids
  of the atmospheric model. Significant differences in the model simulations are found
  in the precipitation fields, however, where heavy rainfall events occur in the region
  of strong cyclonic shear of the easterly waves only on the higher-resolution grid.
  This is because the low-level convergence due to the waves is much larger and more
  realistic in the fine-resolution simulation, which enables heavier precipitation
  events that skew the rainfall distributions toward longer tails. The variability
  in rainfall on these time scales accounts for more than 60%â€“70% of the total variability.
  As a result, the simulation of mean rainfall in the ITCZ and its seasonal migration
  improves in the higher-resolution case. This suggests that capturing these transient
  waves and the resultant strong low-level convergence is one of the key ingredients
  for improving the simulation of precipitation in global coupled climate models.
