abstract: Recent technological advances over the past few decades have enabled the
  development of fully coupled atmosphere-ocean modeling prediction systems that are
  used today to support short-term (days to weeks) and medium-term (10–21 days) needs
  for both the operational and research communities. We overview the coupling framework,
  including model components and grid resolution considerations, as well as the coupling
  physics by examining heat ﬂuxes between atmosphere and ocean, momentum transfer,
  and freshwater ﬂuxes. These modeling systems can be run as fully coupled atmosphere-ocean
  and atmosphere-ocean-wave conﬁgurations. Examples of several modeling systems applied
  to complex coastal regions including Madeira Island, Adriatic Sea, Coastal California,
  Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, and the Maritime Continent are presented. In many of these
  studies, a variety of ﬁeld campaigns have contributed to a better understanding
  of the underlying physics associated with the atmosphere-ocean feedbacks. Examples
  of improvements in predictive skill when run in coupled mode versus standalone are
  shown. Coupled model challenges such as model initialization, data assimilation,
  and earth system prediction are discussed.
