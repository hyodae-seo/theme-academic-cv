abstract: Substantial (∼2°C) basin averaged sea surface temperature (SST) cooling
  in the Banda Sea occurred in less than a 14-day period during the 2015 boreal winter
  Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Such rapid and large cooling associated with the
  MJO has not been reported at least in the last two decades. Processes that control
  the substantial cooling during the 2015 MJO event are examined using high-resolution
  ocean reanalysis and one-dimensional (1-D) ocean model simulations. Previous studies
  suggest that MJO-induced SST variability in the Banda Sea is primarily controlled
  by surface heat flux. However, heat budget analysis of the model indicates that
  entrainment cooling produced by vertical mixing contributes more than surface heat
  flux for driving the basin-wide SST cooling during the 2015 event. Analysis of the
  ocean reanalysis further demonstrates that the prominent coastal upwelling around
  islands in the southern basin occurs near the end of the cooling period. The upwelled
  cold waters are advected by MJO-induced surface currents to a large area within
  the Banda Sea, which further maintains the basin-wide cold SST. These results are
  compared with another MJO-driven substantial cooling event during the boreal winter
  of 2007 in which the cooling is mostly driven by surface heat flux. Sensitivity
  experiments, in which initial temperature conditions for the two events are replaced
  by each other, demonstrate that the elevated thermocline associated with the 2015
  strong El Niño is largely responsible for the intensified cooling generated by the
  vertical mixing with colder subsurface waters.
