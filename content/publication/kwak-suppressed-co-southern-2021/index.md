abstract: The Southern Ocean, an important region for the uptake of anthropogenic
  carbon dioxide (CO2), features strong surface currents due to substantial mesoscale
  meanders and eddies. These features interact with the wind and modify the momentum
  transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean. Although such interactions are known
  to reduce momentum transfer, their impact on air-sea carbon exchange remains unclear.
  Using a 1/20Â° physical-biogeochemical coupled ocean model, we examined the impact
  of the current-wind interaction on the surface carbon concentration and the air-sea
  carbon exchange in the Southern Ocean. The current-wind interaction decreased winter
  partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) at the ocean surface mainly south of the northern
  subantarctic front. It also reduced pCO2 in summer, indicating enhanced uptake,
  but not to the same extent as the winter loss. Consequently, the net outgassing
  of CO2 was found to be reduced by approximately 17% when including current-wind
  interaction. These changes stem from the combined effect of vertical mixing and
  Ekman divergence. A budget analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) revealed
  that a weakening of vertical mixing by current-wind interaction reduces the carbon
  supply from below, and particularly so in winter. The weaker wind stress additionally
  lowers the subsurface DIC concentration in summer, which can affect the vertical
  diffusive flux of carbon in winter. Our study suggests that ignoring current-wind
  interactions in the Southern Ocean can overestimate winter CO2 outgassing.
