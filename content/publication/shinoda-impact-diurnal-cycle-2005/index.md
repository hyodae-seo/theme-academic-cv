abstract: The mechanism by which the diurnal cycle of solar radiation modulates intraseasonal
  SST variability in the western Pacific warm pool is investigated using a one-dimensional
  mixed layer model. SSTs in the model experiments forced with hourly surface fluxes
  during the calm–sunny phase of intraseasonal oscillation are significantly warmer
  than those with daily mean surface fluxes. The difference in two experiments is
  explained by upper-ocean mixing processes during nighttime. Surface warming during
  daytime creates a shallow diurnal warm layer near the surface (0–3 m), which can
  be easily eroded by surface cooling during nighttime. Further cooling, however,
  requires a substantial amount of energy because deeper waters need to be entrained
  into the mixed layer. Since the shallow diurnal layer is not formed in the experiment
  with daily mean surface fluxes, the SST for the hourly forcing case is warmer most
  of the time due to the diurnally varying solar radiation.
