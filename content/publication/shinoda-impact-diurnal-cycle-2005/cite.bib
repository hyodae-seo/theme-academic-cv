 abstract = {The mechanism by which the diurnal cycle of solar radiation modulates intraseasonal SST variability in the western Pacific warm pool is investigated using a one-dimensional mixed layer model. SSTs in the model experiments forced with hourly surface fluxes during the calm–sunny phase of intraseasonal oscillation are significantly warmer than those with daily mean surface fluxes. The difference in two experiments is explained by upper-ocean mixing processes during nighttime. Surface warming during daytime creates a shallow diurnal warm layer near the surface (0–3 m), which can be easily eroded by surface cooling during nighttime. Further cooling, however, requires a substantial amount of energy because deeper waters need to be entrained into the mixed layer. Since the shallow diurnal layer is not formed in the experiment with daily mean surface fluxes, the SST for the hourly forcing case is warmer most of the time due to the diurnally varying solar radiation.},
