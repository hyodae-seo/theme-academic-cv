abstract: Two decades of high-resolution satellite observations and climate modeling
  studies have indicated strong ocean–atmosphere coupled feedback mediated by ocean
  mesoscale processes, including semipermanent and meandrous SST fronts, mesoscale
  eddies, and ﬁlaments. The air–sea exchanges in latent heat, sensible heat, momentum,
  and carbon dioxide associated with this so-called mesoscale air–sea interaction
  are robust near the major western boundary currents, Southern Ocean fronts, and
  equatorial and coastal upwelling zones, but they are also ubiquitous over the global
  oceans wherever ocean mesoscale processes are active. Current theories, informed
  by rapidly advancing observational and modeling capabilities, have established the
  importance of mesoscale and frontalscale air–sea interaction processes for understanding
  large-scale ocean circulation, biogeochemistry, and weather and climate variability.
  However, numerous challenges remain to accurately diagnose, observe, and simulate
  mesoscale air–sea interaction to quantify its impacts on large-scale processes.
  This article provides a comprehensive review of key aspects pertinent to mesoscale
  air–sea interaction, synthesizes current understanding with remaining gaps and uncertainties,
  and provides recommendations on theoretical, observational, and modeling strategies
  for future air–sea interaction research.
