abstract: The upper ocean stratification and circulation in the Bay of Bengal (BoB)
  plays a key role in the northward propagating monsoon intraseasonal oscillation
  during the months of June–August. This region is highly influenced by strong, seasonal
  atmospheric forcing and the oceanic circulation is characterized by dominant mesoscale
  variability and strong horizontal gradients in salinity and temperature during the
  monsoon period. Given the role of the ocean in the monsoon circulation, it is important
  to investigate accurate ocean state estimates and forecasts of the BoB ocean circulation
  in preparation for coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling and predictions. Hence, we
  use a mesoscale-permitting regional implementation of Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) and its adjoint-based four-dimensional
  variational (4DVAR) system to assimilate satellite-derived Sea Surface Height (SSH)
  and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data in the BoB for a period of one month (June
  1 – 30, 2017). It is shown that the MITgcm-BoB 4DVAR assimilation system is able
  to significantly improve the model con­ sistency with the assimilated observations
  in the BoB region, reducing the model-data misfit by 50% and provided a dynamically-consistent
  BoB ocean circulation for the one-month hindcast period. We performed forecasting
  experiments using the state estimate to initialize two forecasts for a period of
  30-days (July 1 – 30, 2017) from the end of the hindcast period. These forecasts
  used either atmosphere reanalysis and ocean analysis forcings or monthly climatology
  of atmosphere reanalysis and ocean analysis forcings. They therefore do not represent
  a “true” regional ocean forecast, forced using actual atmosphere and ocean forecasts,
  but bound the performance between climatological and nearly perfect forecasts. The
  model forecast is a cross-validation against future observations and showed that
  the initial conditions from the state estimate improves the prediction of the three-dimensional
  circulation in the BoB. The model hindcast and forecasts were also crossvalidated
  against independent Argo temperature and salinity observations in the BoB. Additional
  state estimation and forecast experiments for other periods showed similar model
  performance with improved hindcasts and forecasts for the BoB region.
