abstract: Decadal variabilities in Indian Ocean subsurface ocean heat content (OHC;
  50–300 m) since the 1950s are examined using ocean reanalyses. This study elaborates
  on how Paciﬁc variability modulates the Indian Ocean on decadal time scales through
  both oceanic and atmospheric pathways. High correlations between OHC and thermocline
  depth variations across the entire Indian Ocean Basin suggest that OHC variability
  is primarily driven by thermocline ﬂuctuations. The spatial pattern of the leading
  mode of decadal Indian Ocean OHC variability closely matches the regression pattern
  of OHC on the interdecadal Paciﬁc oscillation (IPO), emphasizing the role of the
  Paciﬁc Ocean in determining Indian Ocean OHC decadal variability. Further analyses
  identify different mechanisms by which the Paciﬁc inﬂuences the eastern and western
  Indian Ocean. IPO-related anomalies from the Paciﬁc propagate mainly through oceanic
  pathways in the Maritime Continent to impact the eastern Indian Ocean. By contrast,
  in the western Indian Ocean, the IPO induces winddriven Ekman pumping in the central
  Indian Ocean via the atmospheric bridge, which in turn modiﬁes conditions in the
  southwestern Indian Ocean via westward-propagating Rossby waves. To conﬁrm this,
  a linear Rossby wave model is forced with wind stresses and eastern boundary conditions
  based on reanalyses. This linear model skillfully reproduces observed sea surface
  height anomalies and highlights both the oceanic connection in the eastern Indian
  Ocean and the role of wind-driven Ekman pumping in the west. These ﬁndings are also
  reproduced by OGCM hindcast experiments forced by interannual atmospheric boundary
  conditions applied only over the Paciﬁc and Indian Oceans, respectively.
