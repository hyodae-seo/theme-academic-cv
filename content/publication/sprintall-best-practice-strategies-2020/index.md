abstract: Process studies are designed to improve our understanding of poorly described
  physical processes that are central to the behavior of the climate system. They
  typically include coordinated efforts of intensive field campaigns in the atmosphere
  and/or ocean to collect a carefully planned set of in situ observations. Ideally
  the observational portion of a process study is paired with numerical modeling efforts
  that lead to better representation of a poorly simulated or previously neglected
  physical process in operational and research models. This article provides a framework
  of best practices to help guide scientists in carrying out more productive, collaborative,
  and successful process studies. Topics include the planning and implementation of
  a process study and the associated web of logistical challenges; the development
  of focused science goals and testable hypotheses; and the importance of assembling
  an integrated and compatible team with a diversity of social identity, gender, career
  stage, and scientific background. Guidelines are also provided for scientific data
  management, dissemination, and stewardship. Above all, developing trust and continual
  communication within the science team during the field campaign and analysis phase
  are key for process studies. We consider a successful process study as one that
  ultimately will improve our quantitative understanding of the mechanisms responsible
  for climate variability and enhance our ability to represent them in climate models.
