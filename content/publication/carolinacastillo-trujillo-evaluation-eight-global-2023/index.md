abstract: The Northeast U.S. continental Shelf (NES) extending from the Gulf of Maine
  to Cape Hatteras, is a dynamic region supporting some of the most commercially valuable
  fisheries in the world. This study aims to provide a systematic assessment of eight
  widely used, intermediate-to-high spatial resolution global ocean reanalysis products
  (CFSR, ECCO, ORAS, SODA, BRAN, GLORYS, GOFS3.0, and GOFS3.1) against available in
  situ and satellite ocean observations. In situ observations include water level
  from tide gauges, and temperature and salinity from various sources including shipboard
  hydrographic data, and moorings on the NES. Overall, the coarser resolution products
  exhibit limited skill in the coastal environment, with the high-resolution products
  better representing the temperature and salinity on the NES. Common biases are found
  in all reanalyses and in some regions within the NES; for example, biases in temperature
  and salinity are larger in the southern MidAtlantic Bight than in the rest of the
  NES. There is no single reanalysis that performs well across all parameÂ­ ters in
  all regions within the NES, but GLORYS and BRAN stand out for their superior performance
  across the largest number of metrics, outperforming other products in 22 and 25
  of the 65 metrics examined, respectively. SODA is the top performer among the coarser
  resolution products (CFSR, ECCO, ORAS and SODA). The Gulf Stream and local bathymetry
  are critical factors leading to differences between the reanalyses. Conditions in
  summer are less well represented than in winter. In particular, the Mid-Atlantic
  Bight Cold Pool is not reproduced in four (CFSR, ECCO, ORAS, BRAN) of the eight
  reanalyses.
