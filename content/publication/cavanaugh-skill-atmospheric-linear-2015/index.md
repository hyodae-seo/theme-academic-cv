abstract: A suite of statistical atmosphere-only linear inverse models of varying
  complexity are used to hindcast recent MJO events from the Year of Tropical Convection
  and the Cooperative Indian Ocean Experiment on Intraseasonal Variability/Dynamics
  of the Madden–Julian Oscillation mission periods, as well as over the 2000–2009
  time period. Skill exists for over two weeks, competitive with the skill of some
  numerical models in both bivariate correlation and root-mean-squared-error scores
  during both observational mission periods. Skill is higher during mature Madden–Julian
  Oscillation conditions, as opposed to during growth phases, suggesting that growth
  dynamics may be more complex or non-linear since they are not as well captured by
  a linear model. There is little prediction skill gained by including non-leading
  modes of variability.
