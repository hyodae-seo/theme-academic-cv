abstract: The Bay of Bengal (BoB) upper-ocean salinity is examined in the National
  Centers for Environmental Prediction-Climate Forecasting System version 2 (CFSv2)
  coupled model, Modular Ocean Model version 5 (MOM5), and Indian National Centre
  for Ocean Information Services Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (INC-GODAS).
  CFSv2 displays a large positive salinity bias with respect to World Ocean Atlas
  2013 in the upper 40 m of the water column. The prescribed annual mean river discharge
  and excess evaporation are the main contributors to the positive bias in surface
  salinity. Overestimation of salinity advection also contributes to the high surface
  salinity in the model during summer. The surface salinity bias in MOM5 is smaller
  than in CFSv2 due to prescribed local freshwater flux and seasonally varying river
  discharge. However, the bias is higher around 70 m in summer and 40 m in fall. This
  bias is attributed to excessive vertical mixing in the upper ocean. Despite the
  fact that representation of salinity in INC-GODAS is more realistic due to data
  assimilation, the vertical mixing scheme still imposes systematic errors. The small-scale
  processes that control oceanographic turbulence are not adequately resolved in any
  of these models. Better parameterizations based on dedicated observational programs
  may help improve freshwater representation in regional and global models.
